# 🧠 Project 0: Search – CS50W

This is my solution for **Project 0: Search** from Harvard’s [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/). This project involves building a **Google-style front-end interface** with HTML and CSS that links to real Google search results via GET requests.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ `index.html` for main Google Search
- ✅ `image.html` for Google Image Search
- ✅ `advanced.html` for Google Advanced Search
- ✅ Form submissions using appropriate GET parameters
- ✅ Centered search bar and button styling to resemble Google
- ✅ “I’m Feeling Lucky” button that redirects to top result
- ✅ Responsive navigation links between all pages

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for layout and forms
- **CSS** for styling and layout control
- **GET requests** with query strings for search functionality
- **Browser dev tools** for inspecting request parameters

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Download starter files**  
   [`search.zip`](https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/spring/projects/0/search.zip)

2. **Unzip and open project**  
   Open `index.html` in a web browser.

3. **Test links and search forms**  
   Try out the regular, image, and advanced search functionalities.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main Google Search page
- `image.html`: Google Image Search page
- `advanced.html`: Advanced Search form with four fields
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS for layout and styling

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- Creating functional search forms with custom GET parameters
- Styling form elements and layouts with CSS to mimic real-world interfaces
- Linking between HTML pages using relative paths
- Using browser tools to inspect requests and reverse-engineer behavior

---

## 🧠 Challenge Highlights

- Implementing the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button using a hidden `btnI` field
- Parsing and replicating advanced search behavior using four distinct GET fields
- Ensuring responsive and centered layouts across all screens
- Matching Google’s button styles with minimal CSS
