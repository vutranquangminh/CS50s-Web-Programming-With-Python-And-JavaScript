# CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This repository contains my coursework, projects, and notes from Harvard University's **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**. The course explores modern web development, covering both front-end and back-end technologies, cloud deployment, and scalable design.

## 📚 About This Course

This course dives deep into:
- **Database design**
- **Scalability**
- **Security**
- **User experience (UX)**
- **Cloud services (e.g., GitHub, Heroku)**

Through hands-on projects, I learned how to:
- Build robust web applications using Python and Django
- Design and consume RESTful APIs
- Create interactive front-end interfaces
- Deploy applications to the web

By the end of the course, I gained practical experience with the full web stack and tools used by real-world developers.
